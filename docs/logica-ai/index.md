# Logica + AI

Logic programming belongs to the first wave of Artificial Intelligence, characterized by explicit rule-based reasoning. The second wave introduced statistical and machine learning methods, emphasizing data-driven reasoning. We are now entering a third wave centered on large language models (LLMs). Logica seeks to integrate LLMs with logic programming to enhance data science workflows. 

We have three projects under the Logica+AI umbrella:

- **LogicLM**: Natural language OLAP engine and analytics system.

- **NL2SQL**: Translating natural language queries to SQL queries via Logica

- **NeSy**: Hybrid reasoning system combining strict logic rules with flexible LLM reasoning
