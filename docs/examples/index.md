# Examples
To help you get started, weâ€™ve prepared several examples to familiarize you with Logica through different types of queries. Currently, we cover the following categories:

- Recursive queries
- Aggregation queries
- Aggregation in recursive queries

For each query, we will provide you with the following:

- Problem Definition: A clear description of the problem that the query aims to solve.
- Test Data: Sample data that you can use to test the query.
- Solution: The Logica code that solves the problem.
- Expected Results: The results you should expect when you run the query with the test data.

These examples are designed to help you understand the syntax and capabilities of Logica, and to give you a solid foundation for writing your own queries.
